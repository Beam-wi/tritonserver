# Customize Triton Container

Starting with the r20.10 release, two Docker images are available from
[NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC)](https://ngc.nvidia.com>) that make it
possible to easily construct customized versions of Triton. By
customizing Triton you can significantly reduce the size of the Triton
image by removing functionality that you don't require.

Currently the customization is limited as described below but future
releases will increase the amount of customization that is available.
It is also possible to [build Triton](build.md#building-triton)
yourself to get more exact customization.

The two Docker images used for customization are retrieved using the
following commands.

```
$ docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:<xx.yy>-py3-min
$ docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:<xx.yy>-py3
```

Where <xx.yy> is the version of Triton that you want to customize. The
<xx.yy>-py3-min image is a minimal, base image that contains the CUDA,
cuDNN, etc. dependencies that are required to run Triton. The
<xx.yy>-py3 image contains the complete Triton with all options and
backends.

### Minimum Triton

To create an image containing the minimal possible Triton use the
following multi-stage Dockerfile. As mentioned above the amount of
customization currently available is limited. As a result the minimum
Triton still contains both HTTP/REST and GRPC endpoints, S3 and GCS
filesystem support, and the TensorRT and legacy custom backends.

```
FROM nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:<xx.yy>-py3 as full
FROM nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:<xx.yy>-py3-min
COPY --from full /opt/tritonserver/bin /opt/tritonserver/bin
COPY --from full /opt/tritonserver/lib /opt/tritonserver/lib
```

Then build the image.

```
$ docker build -t tritonserver_min .
```

### Triton with Specific Backends

One or more of the
[PyTorch](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/pytorch_backend),
[TensorFlow1](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorflow_backend),
[TensorFlow2](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorflow_backend),
[ONNX
Runtime](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/onnxruntime_backend),
[Python](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend),
and [DALI](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/dali_backend)
backends can be added to the minimum Triton image. The backend can be
built from scratch or the appropriate backend directory can be copied
from from the full Triton image. For example, to create a Triton image
that creates a minimum Triton plus support for TensorFlow1 use the
following Dockerfile.

```
FROM nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:<xx.yy>-py3 as full
FROM nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:<xx.yy>-py3-min
COPY --from full /opt/tritonserver/bin /opt/tritonserver/bin
COPY --from full /opt/tritonserver/lib /opt/tritonserver/lib
COPY --from full /opt/tritonserver/backends/tensorflow1 /opt/tritonserver/backends/tensorflow1
```

Depending on the backend it may also be necessary to include
additional dependencies in the image. For example, the Python backend
requires that Python3 be installed in the image.
